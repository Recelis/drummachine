This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Drum Machine
his project uses React, Redux, Sass for CSS variables or Material UI (styling typically comes last in the development process) and has been deliberately designed to do more than the User Stories required. It will have an option for saving user inputs, and for automatic replaying and modification. This will ensure that Redux will have to be used in this project.
